# Elevator Simulator

This is a simulation of the functionality of an elevator in a building. Works fine with *one* instance elevator. More instances are not tested yet.

The program's interface is built using **Qt**.

**WARNING:** *Horrible* code. I wrote this when I was in grade 12 for my highschool's *Computer Sciences* course summative.
