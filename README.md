# Elevator Simulator

This is a simulation of the functionality of an elevator in a building. Works perfectly with *one* instance elevator. More instances are not tested yet.

The program's interface is built upon **Qt**.

I coded this for my highschool's *Computer Sciences* course summative.

* The code is published under the FreeBSD license.
